        action: "Completed artifact signing implementation"
        details: |
          Implemented artifact signing with cosign:
          - Created control/compiler/sign.go (signing infrastructure with Secret Manager support)
          - Created workers/cpu-pool/verify.go (signature verification with version whitelist)
          - Created tools/cli/sign_artifact.sh (manual signing script for dev/testing)
          - Created docs/runbooks/artifact-signing.md (comprehensive documentation)
          - Created tests/security/artifact_signing_test.sh (11 tests, all passing)
          - Mock/placeholder implementation for dev - production needs cosign installation
          - Workers verify signatures before loading, reject unsigned/tampered artifacts

        action: "Completed tenant isolation enforcement"
        details: |
          Implemented tenant isolation at every layer:
          - Redis rate limiting with tenant keyspace isolation (apx:rl:{tenant_id}:{resource})
          - Pub/Sub messages with tenant_id attributes and ordering keys
          - Worker per-tenant concurrency limits with semaphores
          - Created positive tests (tenant_isolation_test.sh) - 5 test scenarios
          - Created negative tests (tenant_negative_test.sh) - 7 security boundary tests
          - Comprehensive documentation of isolation model
          All acceptance criteria met. Ready for production validation.

        details: |
          Task V-001 (Request Pathing Smoke Test):
          - Created comprehensive smoke test script (tests/smoke/request_pathing_test.sh)
          - Set up infrastructure services (Redis, Pub/Sub emulator)
          - Created observability configuration files (OTEL, Prometheus, Grafana)
          - Created router Dockerfile for multi-stage build
          - Executed test: 2/6 passing, 4 blocked on implementation gaps
          - Documented 4 blockers preventing end-to-end flow
